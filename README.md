MS DOS/Microsoft Disk Operating System batch files: [.bat]

## MS DOS Batch file programming history

Before the Windows OS/Operating System was invented...which uses the WIMP/Window Icons Mouse Pointer...or, GUI/Graphical User Interface system; there was the MS DOS CLI/Command Line Interface user interface, instead; and, this is just a 'black' screen...which also contains what is known as a prompt.

C:\>

...and, the user would type in command instructions after the prompt.

C:\> DIR

...the above DIR instruction, for example would show the current directory listing of files/folders/-etc.

## How to get help on any MS DOS Command

In order to get help on how to use any MS DOS COMMAND...

C:\> DIR /?

...that is, DIR + space + forwards slash + question mark...; then, press the [ENTER] key...; will display a list of further instructions on how to use the command.

## Batch program files

There are 2 ways to run MS DOS Commands...

1. Interactively, by typing in the commands inside of the MS DOS Command prompt window

In order to open up an MS DOS Command prompt window...  

a -  DO a combination key press: [WINDOWS PICTURE ICON KEY]+[R]...and, a Run dialog box should appear  

b - Type into the Run dialog box: CMD...and, then, press the [OK] button...  
    this should make the 'black' screen MS DOS prompt window appear ready for typing command instructions into  

c - Type: ECHO hello, world...and, press the [ENTER] key...and the words: 'hello, world' will show.  

d - In order to close the MS DOS black screen window...either type: EXIT...then, press [ENTER] key/or else, hit the windows top right [x].  

2. Programmatically, -also, known as 'silent' mode-, by including the commands inside of what is known as a batch program file.

(Instructions are shown below.)

## What are batch [.bat] file programs?

First, a program file is nothing more than a plain text file: [.txt]...; which has been saved using a special filename extension.

A batch file program uses: [filename.bat].

Where the [filename] part can be any filename you please.

The 3 letter filename exension: [.bat] is what turns the otherwise ordinary plain text file into becoming a batch file program, instead.

Batch files contain a list of instructions...MS DOS Commands...which are executed using 'top down flow'...whenever the program runs/executes.

## How to create a batch file program/and, make it execute...

1. Open Windows Notepad word processor program

a. Do a combination key press: [WINDOWS PICTURE ICON KEY]+[R]...and, the Run dialog box should open...

b. Type in to the Run dialog box: Notepad...and, press the [OK] button...should make a Notepad window appear...;  
   ready for typing futher instructions into.

2. Type into the Notepad screen...the following 3 lines of MS DOS code:-

> @ECHO OFF

> ECHO Hello, world!

> PAUSE

3. Use Notepad File menu option to Save the file as being called:  

hw01.bat

4. Go and find the file you saved: [hw01.bat]; and, left double click on it to make it run.

**NOTE**: MS DOS batch file programs are easily identifiable from other programs because it uses a picture icon of 2 cog wheels on top.  
## What are batch file programs used for?

Batch file programs are create for multiple different uses...

1. Create files/delete files

2. Create folders/delete folders

3. Read file text using the console screen...without actually having to open any other program...;  
   so, you can see program code without running it.

4. See your computer/network settings...; and, also, change these.

5. You can shut down the computer

6. -etc...

...basically, MS DOS Batch file programs allows one to control the underlying operating system in general.

7. If MS DOS Batch file commands are either accidentally/or else, delibrately mis-used; then, they can also create a computer 'virus'/or, 'bomb'...which causes the computer to disfunction.

## A list of commonly used MS DOS Commands...

CLS - clear the console screen  
DIR - shows the current directory folder listing  
MKDIR folderName - Creates a new folder with the specified name  
RMDIR folderName - Removes the folder with the specified name  
DEL fileName - delete a file with the specified name
